    <h2>Description</h2>
    A creamy pumpkin soup for autumn. This soup is smooth and flavorful, and the addition of ginger lends a <br>
    sweet and spicy flavor to a traditional seasonal dish. The cinnamon croutons are lovely and make the soup <br>
    reminiscent of pumpkin pie.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can pumpkin purée</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger</li>

            </p>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bread is crisp and topping is bubbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from the
                oven and cut each slice of bread into 8 small triangles or squares. Set croutons aside.

                and simmer for 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally.</li></p>
